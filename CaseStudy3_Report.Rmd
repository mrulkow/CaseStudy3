## Instructions

In the bottom right window, click on the file titled `CaseStudy3_Instructions.pdf`. Thoroughly read through the background and assignment instructions in order to complete the case study below. We encourage you to work on this assignment with a partner, but only active lab approach students may submit their work in pairs.

**Note:** only *active* lab approach students may submit case study assignments with a partner. Your partner must be in the same lab section - and you both must be in attendance during the corresponding lab session. Failure to adhere to these rules will result in a penalty applied to your case study score. *Students that correctly submit as a team will receive 5 points of extra credit towards their final case study score.*

## Data

The `volunteer` dataset contains responses from n = 100 randomly selected members of VolunteerMatch, a national organization that focuses on connecting individuals with volunteer opportunities in their local communities. Each individual sampled volunteered at least once during the previous calendar year (2024). Although VolunteerMatch works to find volunteering opportunities for people of all ages, for the purposes of this assignment, we have restricted the data to volunteers who were college students and volunteers who were retirees. The variables recorded for these individuals include:

1. `wellbeing`: self-reported well-being, measured on a scale from 0-100, with higher values indicating higher overall psychological well-being 
2. `vol.hours`: the total number of hours spent volunteering in 2024
3. `vol.type`: an indicator of whether the individual’s volunteering activities primarily addressed social causes (e.g., volunteering at a soup kitchen or safe house) or environmental causes (e.g., cleaning up trash in a community park)
4. `age.group`: an indicator of whether the volunteer was a college student or a retiree
5. `SES`: a variable indicating the volunteer’s current socioeconomic status (low, medium, high), based on household income
6. `gender`: an indicator of the volunteer’s self-reported gender (female, male)
7. `soc.net`: a variable describing the strength of the volunteer’s social network, recorded as the average number of social interactions the volunteer had per week in the previous calendar year
8. `phys.health`: a score describing the volunteer’s overall health for their age, measured on a scale from 0-10, with higher values indicating better health


Use the following code chunks to read in and preview the data set. 

```{r read_data}
load("volunteer.Rda")
```

```{r preview_data}
head(volunteer)
```

And be sure to load in any necessary packages!

```{r load_packages, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

## Task

Your goal is to build a series of regression models that estimate the overall relationship between an individual’s well-being (wellbeing) and the number of hours they commit to volunteer work (vol.hours). In developing your models, you will demonstrate what you’ve learned about simple and multiple linear regression by evaluating the fit of the models you estimate and discussing what factors are important to consider when analyzing how volunteering relates to a person’s psychological well-being. Your analysis and written report will include the following main components:

1. Simple Linear Regression Analysis: Create a simple linear regression model (Model A) that predicts an individual’s self-reported well-being (wellbeing) using only the number of hours spent volunteering (vol.hours). Use the results of this model to run a population-level test of linear association and construct a confidence interval that estimates the true but unknown population-level slope.

2. Multiple Linear Regression Analyses: Add additional predictors to your initial model to create three multiple linear regression models (Model B, C, and D). These models should satisfy the following criteria:

    - Model B should include vol.hours and at least one additional quantitative predictor. This model should not include any categorical predictors, nor interactions.

    - Model C should include vol.hours and at least one additional quantitative predictor. This model’s set of predictors should differ from the previous model. This model should not include any categorical predictors, nor interactions. 

    - Model D should include vol.hours and one categorical predictor. This model should include an interaction between vol.hours and your categorical predictor. This model should not include any additional quantitative predictors. 

3. Discussion: First, summarize your findings from (1). Then, explain how you selected additional predictors for the multiple linear regression models you created in (2). Summarize your findings from (2) and compare the results to (1). Provide a conclusion regarding whether the number of hours spent volunteering is linearly associated with an individual’s well-being, and whether additional predictors influence this association.

These components should comprise a written report that demonstrates your ability to interpret the results of a regression model and your understanding of how to select helpful predictors.

## Analysis - Simple Linear Regression Model

Use the following code chunks to complete the first data analysis task.

Create a simple linear regression model (ModelA) that predicts an individual’s self-reported well-being (`wellbeing`) using only the number of hours spent volunteering (`vol.hours`). Report the summary results of this model. Create a scatterplot that visualizes the estimated model. Create a 95% confidence interval for the population-level slope.

## Analysis - Multiple Linear Regression Models

Use the following code chunks to complete the second data analysis task.

Use the provided correlogram (above) to determine which explanatory variable(s) might also assist in predicting an individual’s self-reported well-being (`wellbeing`). Create two multiple linear regression models (ModelB and ModelC) that each contain `vol.hours` and at least one additional quantitative predictor. Report the summary results of these models. You do not need to provide graphical representations in this section.

## Analysis - Multiple Linear Regression Model with an Interaction

Use the following code chunks to complete the third data analysis task.

Create one last multiple linear regression model (ModelD) that contains `vol.hours` and one categorical predictor. This model should include an interaction between `vol.hours` and your categorical predictor. Report the summary results of this model. Create a scatterplot that visualizes the estimated interaction.
